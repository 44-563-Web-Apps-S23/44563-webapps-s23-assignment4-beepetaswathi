        <h4>THE GAZING GLOBE</h4>
        <h4>_Eugene Pillot_</h4>

        <p>     [OHANO _and_ NIJO _sit upon mats near the window, partly facing
            each other_.
       
       OHANO. They--they gave you a sword at the boat.
       <br>
       NIJO. [_Wearily._] Oh, yes.
       <br>
       OHANO. Even from up here we could see its jewels flash.
       <br>
       NIJO. [_Without interest._] Yes, it is cunningly conceived.
       <br>
       OHANO. How wonderful it must be. Perhaps--I may see it?
       <br>
       NIJO. [_Still wearily._] If you so desire.
       <br>
            [_Unbuckles sword and holds it before himself for her to examine.
            She leans over it admiringly, touching the jewels as she speaks of
            them._
        <br>
       OHANO. Magnificent! Rubies and emeralds and sapphires! And here are
       moonstones and diamonds. How you must prize it.
       <br>
       NIJO. [_Wearily._] Of course, one must.
       <br>
       OHANO. And the very people who tried to stop you from going across the
       sea to win your glory have given it to you.
       <br>
       NIJO. That is the way of the world.
       <br>
       OHANO. Show me the way to glory, Nijo.
       <br>
       NIJO. And why?
       <br>
       OHANO. I would travel it too.
       <br>
       NIJO. You--a simple island maiden?
       <br>
       OHANO. I'm not simple. I've grown beyond the people here.
       <br>
       NIJO. But there is glory in the work women must do at home.
       <br>
       OHANO. And I have done my share of it. I want bigger work now--out in
       the world.
       <br>
       NIJO. But the simple tasks must be done.
       <br>
       OHANO. I am sick unto death of doing them!
