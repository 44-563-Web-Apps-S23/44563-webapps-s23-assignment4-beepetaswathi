        <h4>THE GAZING GLOBE</h4>
        <h4>_Eugene Pillot_</h4>

        <p>     [OHANO _and_ NIJO _sit upon mats near the window, partly facing
            each other_.</p>]
       
       <h6>OHANO.</h6> <p>They--they gave you a sword at the boat.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>NIJO.</h6> [<p>_Wearily._</p>] <p>Oh, yes.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>OHANO.</h6> <p>Even from up here we could see its jewels flash.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>NIJO.</h6> [<p>_Without interest._</p>] <p>Yes, it is cunningly conceived.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>OHANO.</h6> <p>How wonderful it must be. Perhaps--I may see it?</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>NIJO.</h6> [<p>_Still wearily._</p>] <p>If you so desire.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
            [<P>._Unbuckles sword and holds it before himself for her to examine.
            She leans over it admiringly, touching the jewels as she speaks of
            them._</P>]
        <br>
        <br>
       <h6>OHANO.</h6> <P>Magnificent! Rubies and emeralds and sapphires! And here are
       moonstones and diamonds. How you must prize it.</P>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>NIJO.</h6>[<P>_Wearily._</P>] <P>Of course, one must.</P>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>OHANO.</h6><p>And the very people who tried to stop you from going across the
       sea to win your glory have given it to you.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h6>NIJO.</h6><p>That is the way of the world.</p>
